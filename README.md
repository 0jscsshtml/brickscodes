  * If submitted as a draft (incomplete form), all filled-in data is saved. The user will receive an email containing a secure, time-based token URL.
  * If submitted as a draft, you may choose to exclude fields from saving.
  * Upon clicking the link, the user is automatically returned to the form page, where the token is validated, and the form is pre-filled with the saved data.
  * Subsequent submissions, whether normal or draft, will update the existing record in the database (no new entries), with proper data sanitization.

* Confirmation Popup Modal Before Submission (Module)
